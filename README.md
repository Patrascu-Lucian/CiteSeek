## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript 5.9 (strict) · Tailwind v4 ·
shadcn/ui · Postgres 18 + pgvector · Drizzle ORM · Vitest + Testing Library ·
Playwright · GitHub Actions

Auth.js and the RAG pipeline arrive in the next slices.

## Getting started

Requires Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`) and pnpm 11.

```bash
nvm use                      # Node 24 LTS
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in DATABASE_URL
docker compose up -d         # or point DATABASE_URL at a Neon branch
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev               # dev server
pnpm build             # production build
pnpm test              # vitest unit tests (no database needed)
pnpm test:integration  # vitest against a real Postgres (needs DATABASE_URL)
pnpm test:e2e          # playwright (builds and serves automatically)
pnpm lint              # eslint, type-aware
pnpm typecheck         # tsc --noEmit
pnpm format            # prettier --write
```

Database:

```bash
docker compose up -d   # local Postgres 18 + pgvector
pnpm db:migrate        # apply migrations (creates the vector extension too)
pnpm db:seed           # demo workspace; idempotent
pnpm db:generate       # emit a new migration after editing lib/db/schema.ts
pnpm db:studio         # browse the database
```

`format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`, integration tests, and the
Playwright smoke suite all gate every pull request.

## Project conventions

- **Decisions** worth defending are recorded in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).
- **Corrections made on review** are logged in [`docs/code-review-notes.md`](docs/code-review-notes.md).
- **Out-of-milestone ideas** go to [`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md), not the current branch.

Built with AI-assisted tooling (Claude Code) under close review — see
[`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) for the architectural reasoning.

## Known gaps at this milestone

The landing page CTAs (`/sign-in`, `/demo`) are not implemented yet — they arrive with
Auth.js and guest mode in Slice 3. Tracked in [`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md).
